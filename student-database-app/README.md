# Student Database App

A simple app that allows me to create an application to manage student enrollments and balance.

Specifications:
* Ask the user how many students will be added to the database
* Prompt the user to enter the name and year for each student
* Each student should have a 5-digit unique ID, with the first number being their grade level
* A student can enroll in various courses
* Each course costs 600 to enroll
* The student should be able to view their balance and pay the tuition
* Check student status: Name, ID, courses enrolled and balance

Updates: 
* General outline of the app defined
* Finished the basic app
* To do: Restrict the class options
